## ðŸš€ About Me
Hello, I'm Tabeea, diving into Python programming. Just embarked on my GitHub journey by creating a project for my IT Factory course exam, applying what I've learned in the process.  
Excited to learn, collaborate, and grow! ðŸš€


## Project name: ShoppingList 

### Intro

The ShoppingList web application offers users the possibility to manage a shopping list by allowing the addition or removal of products. Users also have the option to repurchase items they have already bought.

Furthermore, the application provides a dedicated page with tips to guide users in making intelligent purchases while adhering to their available budget. This feature adds an educational and informative dimension to the online shopping experience.
